# 🕳️ Pothole Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains a **trained YOLOv8 object detection model** along with a **simple inference script** to detect potholes in road images.

The project is designed to demonstrate **end-to-end pothole detection**, from a trained deep learning model to practical image-based inference. It serves as a strong foundation for future extensions such as **mobile camera detection, web deployment, GPS-based mapping, and smart road monitoring systems**.

## 🧪 Inference Script

The repository includes a **simple Python inference script** that:
- Loads the trained YOLOv8 model
- Accepts an input image
- Runs pothole detection
- Draws bounding boxes with confidence scores
- Saves the output image

This script is intended for **testing and evaluating the trained model**.
